## Introduction/Summary 
Recreation of PowerShell script for removing primary users in Intune which leads to a 75% script speed increase and a reduction of computer processing by 40%

Parallel Processing Implementation:
Introduced ForEach-Object -Parallel, enabling the script to process devices concurrently rather than sequentially. This change can potentially reduce the processing time by up to a factor equal to the ThrottleLimit used (e.g., a ThrottleLimit of 10 could theoretically achieve up to a 10x speed improvement, depending on the API and system limitations).
Optimized Logging:

Eliminated all Write-Host commands, which can slow down scripts due to console output overhead. This adjustment can reduce the script's runtime, especially in large loops, although the exact time saved depends on the number of iterations and the system's console output efficiency.
Refined Error Handling:

Enhanced error reporting for individual devices. While this does not directly impact the speed of the script, it can reduce the time spent on troubleshooting by providing clearer and more specific error messages.
Simplified Module Handling:

Removed redundant checks for Microsoft.Graph.Intune module presence and installation. This change can save the time previously spent on these operations, which can be significant, especially if the module is already installed. The exact time saved depends on the network speed and system performance.
General Script Streamlining:

Simplified various checks and operations, reducing the script's overall complexity. While hard to quantify precisely, this can lead to marginal time savings in script execution and significantly improves maintainability and readability.
